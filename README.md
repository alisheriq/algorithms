## Explanation of the Assignments
<details>
<summary>Assignment 1.</summary>
<details>
<summary>Task 1.</summary>
This task creates an array of integers and then calls a function called findMin to find the minimum value in that array. The findMin function is a recursive function that takes an array and the length of that array as inputs and returns the minimum value in the array.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Task 2.</summary>
This task creates an array of integers and then calls a function called findAvg to find the average value of the elements in the array. The findAvg function is a recursive function that takes an array and the length of that array as inputs and returns the sum of the elements in the array.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Task 3.</summary>
This task checks whether a given number is prime or composite. It does this by calling a function called checkComp which is a recursive function that takes a number to check and the number itself as inputs. It returns "Prime" if the number is prime, and "Composite" if the number is composite.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Task 4.</summary>
This task finds the factorial of a given number by calling a function called findFactorial. The findFactorial function is a recursive function that takes a number as input and returns the factorial of that number.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Task 5.</summary>
This task finds the nth term of the Fibonacci sequence by calling a function called findFibonacci. The findFibonacci function is a recursive function that takes a number as input and returns the nth term of the Fibonacci sequence.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Task 6.</summary>
This task finds the nth power of a given number by calling a function called findPower. The findPower function is a recursive function that takes a number and the power to raise that number to as inputs, and returns the nth power of that number.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Task 7.</summary>
This task reverses an array by calling a function called makeReverse. The makeReverse function is a recursive function that takes the size of the array as input and then reads in the elements of the array from the user using a scanner. It then recursively prints out the elements of the array in reverse order.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Task 8.</summary>
This task checks if a given string consists only of digits by calling a function called checkForDigits. The checkForDigits function is a recursive function that takes an array of characters and the length of that array as inputs and returns "Yes" if the string consists only of digits, and "No" otherwise.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Task 9.</summary>
This task finds the binomial coefficient (n choose k) by calling a function called findBinomialCoeff. The findBinomialCoeff function is a recursive function that takes two numbers, n and k, as inputs and returns the binomial coefficient (n choose k).
</details>

<details>
<summary>Task 10.</summary>
Task 10 calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers. The function takes two integer parameters, and uses recursion to calculate the GCD by using the modulo operator to find the remainder of the first integer divided by the second integer. The function returns the second integer if the remainder is zero, or recursively calls itself with the second integer as the first parameter and the remainder as the second parameter until the remainder is zero.
