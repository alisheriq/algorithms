<summary>myArrayList class</summary>
The MyArrayList class is a generic class that implements the MyList interface. It represents a dynamic array that can hold objects of any type. 
Here is a description of each method in the class:
<details>
<summary>click</summary>
MyArrayList(): This is the constructor of the class. It creates a new MyArrayList object with an initial capacity of 5 elements.

add(Object item): This method adds the specified item to the end of the array. If the array is full, the method calls increaseBuffer() to double its size.

add(Object item, int index): This method adds the specified item at the specified index in the array. If the array is full, the method calls increaseBuffer() to double its size. It also shifts all the elements to the right of the specified index to make space for the new element.

get(int index): This method returns the element at the specified index in the array. It throws an IndexOutOfBoundsException if the index is out of bounds.

checkIndex(int index): This is a helper method that checks if the specified index is within bounds of the array. If the index is out of bounds, it throws an IndexOutOfBoundsException.

increaseBuffer(): This is a helper method that doubles the capacity of the array.

remove(int index): This method removes the element at the specified index from the array. It also shifts all the elements to the right of the specified index to the left to fill the gap.

remove(T item): This method removes the first occurrence of the specified item from the array by calling remove(int index).

size(): This method returns the number of elements in the array.

contains(Object o): This method checks if the array contains the specified object. It returns true if the object is found, and false otherwise.

clear(): This method clears the array by creating a new array of the same size and setting the size to 0.

indexOf(Object o): This method returns the index of the first occurrence of the specified object in the array. If the object is not found, it returns -1.

lastIndexOf(Object o): This method returns the index of the last occurrence of the specified object in the array. If the object is not found, it returns -1.

sort(): This method sorts the elements in the array in ascending order using the bubble sort algorithm. The elements must be Comparable.
